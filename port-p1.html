      <p> Joy farm is the stand-in name for an "Intentional Living Community" (a commune, if you don't find that to be a dirty word) that will be coming to fruition in 2021.</p>
      <p> We seek to build a community that centers around key values of Joy, Liberation, and Creation. We seek to be explicitly abolitionist and engaged with both local and global politics, while understanding that most governmental systems must be completely deconstructed and rebuilt for our society to be equitable. </p>
      <p> Our early development goals include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> developing self sufficiancy through farming, and making. </li>
          <li> finding ways to participate in mutual aid in nearby communities </li>
          <li> building support systems for artists and creatives who wish to take up residency </li>
          <li> generate sustainable income to allow for community members to focus on projects and passions, rather than surviving in capitalist society </li>
        </ul>
